# RSA FACTORING CHALLENGE

The script is called "RSA Challenge",
 and its purpose is to factorize numbers that are provided in a file as input.
 Factoring a number means finding its prime factors, which are the smaller prime numbers
 that, when multiplied together, produce the original number.
 For example, the prime factors of 24 are 2, 2, 2, and 3, because 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 = 24.
